The Honor Watch 5 Ultra is released with the sudden cardiac arrest screening feature by deceleration capacity of rate, i.e. DC. And this is also the first self-developed feature in Honor Health Study platform :sparkles:. As the lead developer, I am honored to declare that this is the industry's first smart wearable device to support sudden cardiac arrest screening research uses heart rate deceleration force detection to assess the vagus nerve's ability to regulate heart rate, identify potential heart health risks, and guide users in managing their heart health.

This feature was implemented with millons of heart health-related data like physiological signals by combination of deceleration capacity related theories and deep learning algorithms, including but not limited to constrastive learning and time series forecasting.
