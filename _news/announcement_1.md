The Honor Watch 5 Pro is released with 24-hour continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring feature. This is currently the first wearable device on the market capable of real-time BP monitoring :sparkles:. It offers multiple measurement modes, including 40-second single measurement and trend tracking. It also provides non-pharmacological suggestions for blood pressure control, guiding habit adjustments based on factors such as salt intake, sleep, and exercise.

As the lead developer, I am honored to declare that it has met the US Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard with calibration. The algorithm pipeline includes BP regression from the collected physiological signals and calibration with true labels from Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. Fancy techniques including but not limited to implicit feature alignment in the hidden space and conditional generation are involved in the algorithm.
