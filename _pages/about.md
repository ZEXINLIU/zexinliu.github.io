I am the advanced algorithm engineer at HONOR, responsible for the research and development of health feature related algorithms on wearable devices. As the lead developer, I successfully spearheaded the commercialization of key products, including the sudden cardiac arrest screening feature by deceleration capacity of rate (DC) in the Honor Watch 5 Ultra, and the 24-hour continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring feature in the Honor Watch 5 Pro.

Previously: I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from University of Utah, advised by Akil Narayan. During my PhD, my research interest are scientific computing and uncertainty quantification. Specificaly, I improved the algorithm of computing three-term currence coefficients for (univariate) generalized polynomials and filled the gap in the multivariate case. Then using them as fundamental tools, as one of the main contributors, I developed and distributed a new open-source Python-based software tool, [UncertainSCI](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/UncertainSCI) coworking with Professor [Rob Macleod's team](https://www.sci.utah.edu/~macleod/). This Python-based toolkit employs advanced parameter sampling techniques to build polynomial chaos (PC) emulators that can be used to predict model outputs for general parameter values for computational biomedical simulations. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Beihang University, where I met my wife :smile:.
