I am the advanced algorithm engineer at HONOR, responsible for the research and development of health feature related algorithms on wearable devices.  Mathematically, I'm foucsing on the research of flow matching generative modeling, multimodal contrastive learning, and Physics-informed learing for physical sciences applications including molecular dynamics and fluid mechanics. I'm also foucsing on the study of large medical models by RAG and finetuing techniques. Relevant theoretical foundations and personal insights have been categorized and posted on the website's blogs.

As the lead developer, I successfully spearheaded the commercialization of key products, including the sudden cardiac arrest screening feature by deceleration capacity of rate (DC) in the Honor Watch 5 Ultra, and the 24-hour continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring feature in the Honor Watch 5 Pro.

Previously: I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from University of Utah, advised by Professor [Akil Narayan](https://www.sci.utah.edu/~akil/). During my PhD, my research interest are scientific computing and uncertainty quantification. Specificaly, I improved the algorithm of computing three-term currence coefficients for [univariate](https://github.com/ZEXINLIU/Uni_ttr_examples) generalized polynomials and filled the gap in the [multivariate](https://github.com/ZEXINLIU/Multi_ttr_examples) case. Then using them as fundamental tools, as one of the main contributors, I developed and distributed a new open-source Python-based software tool, [UncertainSCI](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/UncertainSCI) coworking with Professor [Rob Macleod's team](https://www.sci.utah.edu/~macleod/). This Python-based toolkit employs advanced parameter sampling techniques to build polynomial chaos (PC) emulators that can be used to predict model outputs for general parameter values for computational biomedical simulations. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Beihang University, where I met my wife :smile:.
